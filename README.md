# Correlation analysis of crimes in NSW

Python code to analyse relationships among crimes in NSW based on data from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research.

# Loading libraries

Let's load relevant Python libraries.


```python
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import seaborn as sns 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import matplotlib as mpl
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
from itertools import cycle
import time
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
```

# Loading data

The original data acquired from https://www.bocsar.nsw.gov.au/Pages/bocsar_datasets/Datasets-.aspxNSW. It contains monthly data on all criminal incidents recorded by police from 1995 to Mar 2020. It was processed and cleaned https://github.com/codegression/Predicting-domestic-voilence-in-NSW. Now we are going to use the processed file.


```python
data = pd.read_csv('crimes_nsw.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
```


```python
data.head()
```

# Exploratory data analysis

Let's analyze all the 62 types of crimes. 


```python
np.random.seed(4)
colors = np.random.choice(list(mpl.colors.XKCD_COLORS.keys()), len(data.columns), replace=False)
cycler = cycle('bgrcmk')
```


```python
for i in range(len(data.columns)):
    data[data.columns[i]].plot(kind = 'line', color =colors[i],linewidth=2,alpha = 1,grid = True,linestyle = '-')
plt.legend(loc='upper right')     
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1))   
plt.xlabel('')              
plt.ylabel('Number of cases')
plt.title('Monthly plot of various crimes in NSW')            
plt.show()

Let's plot a heatmap of the correlation matrix where highly correlated pairs are colored in pink.


```python
mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr, dtype=np.bool))
f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11, 9))
cmap = sns.diverging_palette(220, 10, as_cmap=True)
sns.heatmap(corr, mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0,
            square=True, linewidths=.5)
```

Since the correlation table is too big, let's loop through column by column. Let's set the threshold as 0.8 and find strongly positively and negatively correlated columns.


```python
